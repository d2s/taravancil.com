In a large bowl, salt and pepper the cubed meat. Mix and set aside. In a Dutch
oven or large pot, heat some oil to its smoke point. Place the meat in the pan,
letting brown for a few minutes without turning. Turn, then continue cooking
until the meat is browned.

Remove the meat and set aside. Add the carrots, onion, and celery to the pot,
optionally adding more oil or some butter. Saute for ~4 minutes.

Add the minced garlic. Saute for about 30 seconds.

Add the stock, and use a wooden spoon to scrape the brown goodness from
the bottom of the pan. Add marmite, tomato paste, tomatoes, barley, and bay
leaves.

Bring to a boil, then simmer for ~2 hours. Serve immediately or store in fridge
for up to 5 days.
