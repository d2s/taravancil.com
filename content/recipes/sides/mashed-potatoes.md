**Warning: this is one of my "eyeball recipes", which means I've never
measured how much cream, butter, or salt to use. Add them slowly and taste as
you go.**

Boil a pot of water. Add the potatoes and cook until you can pierce them with
a fork.

In a large bowl, mash the potatoes. Use a hand mixer or masher (a whisk can
stand in for a masher if you don't have one).

Add butter, cream/milk, and salt and pepper. If you're feeling fancy, you can add
chopped green onions, roasted minced garlic, chopped bacon, or whatever
flavors you fancy.

*Note: It's blasphemous to use low/non-fat dairy in any dish, but did you know
it's actually illegal to use in mashed potatoes? Sorry, I don't make the rules.*
