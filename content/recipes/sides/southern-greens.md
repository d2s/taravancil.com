Sautee the onion in butter or oil.

Add broth and chili flakes, then bring to a boil.

Add greens and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer for ~1 hour.

*Note: For extra flavor, if you're making stock on the same day you're cooking
the greens, throw the bones/meat you used to make the stock into the pot while
the greens simmer.*
