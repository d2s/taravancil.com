**Warning: this is one of my "eyeball recipes", which means I've never
measured how much cream, butter, or salt to use. Add them slowly and taste as
you go.**

Boil a pot of water. Add cauliflower and cook for 7-8 minutes or until you can
pierce it with a fork.

In a large bowl, mash the cauliflower. I've found that the easiest way to mash
cauliflower is to use a whisk to mash and smash the florets.

Add butter, cream/milk, and salt and pepper. If you're feeling fancy, you can add
chopped green onions, roasted minced garlic, chopped bacon, or whatever
flavors you fancy.

use low/non-fat dairy in this dish.*
