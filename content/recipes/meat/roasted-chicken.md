---

Preheat oven to 375Â°F.

Rinse and drain the chicken, and place in in a baking dish.

Slice the butter, and stuff it under the chicken's skin. Salt and pepper the
exterior of the chicken.

Bake for 1 1/2 hours or until skin is golden and crisp.

*Note: I sometimes add thyme or rosemary to the outside of the chicken. Paprika
and cumin is a nice combination too.*
