Preheat oven to 400Â°F.

Mix milk and breadcrumbs in a bowl.

In a large bowl, combine whisked egg, onion, and salt. Add pepper if desired.
Add ground meat and breadcrumbs mixture, and gently fold all ingredients
together. The mixture should be combined, but avoid over-working the meat.

Form mixture into balls (mine are usually about 1 Tbsp. each), and place on a
baking sheet or glash dish. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until brown.
