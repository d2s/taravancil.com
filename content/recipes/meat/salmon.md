Salt and pepper the skinless side of the filet. Add oil or butter to a skillet,
then heat over high heat. Place the filet skin-down in the pan.

After 2-3 minutes, reduce heat to low, and cook for 3-4 minutes more. Flip the
filet, and cook for 2-3 minutes.

Top with lemon juice. The outer meat should still be moist and flaky, and the
inside warm, but uncooked.
