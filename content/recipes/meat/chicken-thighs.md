Preheat oven to 350Â°F.

Liberally salt and pepper the chicken thighs. Bake for 20-25 minutes. I don't
actually know how long to bake them. Just bake them until the skin is crispy.

Serve with pasta and sauce, with potatoes, vegetables, or pretty much anything.

*Note: I sometimes add paprika and cumin. Or squeeze some lemon on the meat
before baking.*
