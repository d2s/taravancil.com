Combine a generous splash of beer and the onions and/or sauerkraut in a sauté
pan. Nestle the brats in the combination, then bring to a gentle boil. Adjust
heat to low. Cover and simmer and until the meat reaches an internal temperature of
140°F, ~12 minutes.

Heat oil in a non-stick pan. Brown the brats in the non-stick pan. Move back
to beer mixture to rest, about 10 minutes.
