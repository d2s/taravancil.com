  - 1 lb. ground beef, or cooked shredded chicken

Preheat oven to 350Â°F.

Over low heat, melt the butter. Whisk in flour and continue cooking for about 1
minute. Add enchilada sauce and mix. Set aside.

Brown the ground beef and onion. Season with salt and pepper. Optionally add
some chili powder, cumin, and paprika.

Pour half of the enchilada sauce into the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.

### Rolling the enchiladas

Each enchilada is basically a mini taco. Add some ground beef, chiles, and
cheese to each, then roll tightly and place them side-by-side in the baking
dish. I'm usually able to fit 8 tortillas in the dish. Top with remaining sauce
and cheese.

Bake for 20 minutes. Serve with sour cream, avocado, green onions, etc.
