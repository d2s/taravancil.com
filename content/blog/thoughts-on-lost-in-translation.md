I recently watched [Lost in Translation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/),
a film chronicling the loneliness of two Americans in Tokyo. One a young
philosophy graduate and wife pondering her purpose over cigarettes and the Tokyo
skyline from her hotel window, another a jaded movie star-turned-TV commercial
actor burning cigars and time in a hotel bar between shoots. Their friendship,
while forbidden by their respective marriages, and sometimes uncomfortable to
witness, is forged with their shared ennui, and begs viewers to question if they
might someday enter their steady state of pale, muted emotion.

> Charlotte: I just don't know what I'm supposed to be.

> Bob: You'll figure
that out. The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let
things upset you.

As Bob shares with Charlotte in the throes of his midlife crisis, it's hard --
marriage and children, that is. It's heartbreaking to see Bob's deeply-rooted
love for his family displayed as plainly as his yearning for a life outside of
being a married family man. His lack of excitement about his marriage, along
with my own observation of lifeless marriages, urges me to wonder how rich,
passionate relationships devolve into ones marked by obligation and fatigue. I
was brought to tears at several moments throughout the film, because I fear
Charlotte and Bob's disconnection from vulnerability and raw emotion. I'm guilty
of their error, of distancing myself from honest feeling. I need to be wary of
falling into that all-too-familiar trap.

Although the prospect of marriage, children, and hopefully, spiritless existence
is in my distant future, the film still resonated with my current ruminations.
I'm in a budding relationship filled with vigor and connection and it pains me
to imagine it deteriorating into a listless partnership. This film, albeit
morbid, offered a biting reflection on the vulnerability of a life deadened by
humdrum, dispassionate existence, and the effort required to avoid becoming lost
in translation.
