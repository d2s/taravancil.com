I don't have a formal CS education, so one thing I'm focusing on at RC
is filling in the gaps in my knowledge of data structures and
algorithms. Today I focused on sorting algorithms.

I learned about and implemented [insertion
sort](https://gist.github.com/taravancil/2ae627050856dde5d221ca810310e26f)
and
[quicksort](https://gist.github.com/taravancil/6c0a568d1fa84c7f9ef962ba24ea4be8),
in the process became much more confident with Big O notation. I used
to be intimidated by evaluating algorithm efficiency, but as with most
unfamiliar concepts, it's much less complicated than I'd made it out
to be.

I also started working implementing Raft in Rust. I read [the Raft
paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc14/atc14-paper-ongaro.pdf)
a couple of weeks ago and I feel confident that I understand it well enough to
jump in and write and implementation. However, I do have a [few questions in my
notes](https://github.com/taravancil/reading-notes/blob/master/papers/raft-short.org#questions),
so if you know about Raft maybe you'd be able to help me clarify some things?
