I grew up in a rural area, in a town with a population of < 300. In addition to
a lack of diversity of ideas and people in my community, we couldn't afford a
computer, we didn't own a lot of books, and our public library sucked, so I
didn't have access to much information as a kid.

I didn't realize how closed off from the outside world I was until 2010, when I
began my first year of college. Despite excelling in high school (big fish in a
little pond), my eagerness to learn and excel in college was met by a dire
realization that I was far behind my classmates in terms of cultural competence
and general exposure to diverse ideas. Completing my classwork and scoring well
on tests proved to be no issue, but in classes like history, literature, or
philosophy, my lack of exposure was abundantly clear to me. Reading books,
talking about politics, and learning about the world at large just wasn't a part
of how my family operated.

The realities of being an average fish in a big pond set in quickly; by the end
of my first semester at college, I felt lost and hopeless. My classmates were
excelling - they were already conducting research with professors and presenting
papers at conferences. I had just learned why professors were addressed as "Dr."

I never caught up to my classmates while in college. At face value, this is not
an issue. We can expect inequalities to emerge among differing populations; some
people work harder, are smarter, fall on better luck, etc. But I'll be frank, I
was envious of my peers that seemed to understand how to play the game. They
were more interesting and talented, they played instruments, spoke multiple
languages, and had traveled the world, and thus were better poised to succeed
after graduation and contribute meaningfully to the world. Even when I performed
well in classes, or felt like I learned something useful, I felt overwhelmed by
the vastness of what I didn't know, and convinced myself that I would never be
able to cover lost ground. I was depressed, and terrified that I would end up
being unemployed, or at best working a 9-5 job that didn't require any special
skills or talents. For someone who grew up feeling financial hardship on the
regular, and longed for something better, this was a tough pill to swallow.

## A Turning Point

During the summer of 2012, I worked on my college's residence hall maintenance
team. While students were away, our task was to repaint walls, unclog showers,
replace broken fixtures, etc. It wasn't the most glamorous job, but it was
enjoyable thanks to the good company. I'll never forget the day one of my
coworkers asked me if I had ever heard of a site called "Reddit". I hadn't.
After he explained he concept of subreddits and the front page, I was intrigued.
I had never used anything like it, but it seemed like something I would enjoy,
so I gave it a shot. For a short while, I found the endless cat pictures and
silly memes amusing enough to completely capture my attention, but not long
after that I learned of more substantial subreddits like r/science, r/AMA, and
r/technology. Though quite tame in terms of subreddit depth, for someone whose
exposure to the Internet was limited, it was a treasure trove of new information
and ideas. I was hooked.

From that point forward, a ziploc baggie was just as essential a tool during the
workday as my paint brush. I would wrap my phone in the bag, which protected it
from paint splatters, while still allowing me to scroll through Reddit with one
hand, while the other hand painted countless walls, ceilings, and railings. I
spent hundreds of hours doing this, and learned a great deal that summer.

Fast forward to June of 2013. I was a McNair Scholar, and I was supposed to be
conducting research about the relationships between midwives, OB-GYNs, and state
legislators, but frankly, I was mildly disinterested in the research medium.
Feedback was intermittent and progress felt painstakingly slow, and I just
didn't have the attention span to see it through. Though I had access to
thousands of relevant research articles through my university's library, there
were still a substantial number that sat behind paywalls. Unless I paid $30ish
dollars a pop, I couldn't access them. I was frustrated. I couldn't understand
how it was acceptable for publicly-funded research to not only be entirely
inaccessible to the people who paid for it, let alone universities who pay for
it twice over.

So I wrote [this]() short essay about my feelings on the subject, and in the
process learned about Aaron Swartz's efforts, and the heartbreaking end to his
life's work. I was enraged, and I entered my senior year of college with a foul
taste in my mouth, left behind by what I had learned about the status of
academic research and publishing. Call it a major case of senioritis if you
will, but I had zero motivation to graduate.

By the beginning of the spring semester of my senior year, it was abundantly
clear that I did not want to graduate - I started skipping almost all of my
classes and instead pursued hobbies at home: I read for pleasure, I wrote
because I had something to say, and I even picked up computer programming again
for the first time in years. I was having so much fun, and learning more than I
felt like I had all throughout college. It wasn't long before I officially
dropped out, packed up my car, and drove to Austin to find out what a new life
might be like.

### The Revolution Begins

When I first arrived in Austin, I had a part time job maintaining a website for
a small publication, I delivered pizza on the weekend to make ends meet, and I
served as the campaign manager for a local politcal candidate I was busy and
tired, yet I was reading and learning more than ever! I listened to hundreds of
hours of podcasts while delivering pizzas, engaged in meaningful political
conversation on the campaign trail, and most importantly, I started learning web
development.

Working at this magazine was my first real-life exposure to working with HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript, and I was so intrigued. I read documentation, blogs, and
tutorials day-in and day-out. I started following web developers on Twitter,
with the hope that they might share useful links. I studied source code with
dedication. I was finally excited about learning, and learning I was.

And this was only the beginning. I've learned more in the past year than I think
I learned throughout 3 1/2 years of college. More importantly, I renewed my
faith in my my own intelligence and curiosity.

A year ago I knew shit aobut the Internet and software. Sometimes I still feel
like I know shit, but if I'm honest with myself, I know that's not true. Here's
a list of just some of the things I've learned in the past year. I'm proud of
myself.

* version control systems, especially git the importance of writing and
* implementing unit tests early writing scalable and modular front end code how
* large scale software projects test and continuously integrate code the ins and
* outs of JavaScript how to use the command line vim accessibility on the web
* how to use devtools to debug code, measure performance, and more performance
* on the web the differences between web pages and web apps, and when each is
* useful browser extensions, and the properties they provide asynchronous module
* definition optimizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for delivery to the browser
* Bitcoin and blockchains Austrian economics anarchist philosophy distributed
* systems the "darknet" how the Internet protocol works TLS certificate
* authorities PKIs certificate pinning end-to-end encryption data integrity,
* authentication, and other properties the Axolotl protocol WebCryptoAPI
* subresource integrity ... and more

I'm in the middle of an information revolution. The Internet is still very new
to me, but I can say with confidence it is the reason I've learned as much as I
have in such a short amount of time. And while the Internet only succeeds
because of the joint efforts of billions, I feel confident saying that I
wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for Aaron Swartz. In 2012, Reddit was my first exposure to the vastness of the Internet. He co-founded Reddit. A year later, I was inspired by his efforts to make information freely and readily available by all. His life and death fueled my frustrations with the proverbial system, and encouraged me to pursue an alternative path.

## Thank You

It's because of Aaron, and people like Aaron, that today I feel more empowered
to contribute meaningfully to the world. Just a few short years ago, I felt
overwhelmed by what I didn't know, to the point that I thought to give up
because I would never catch up. Today, the vastness of the unknown fills me with
passionate curiosity.

So to those who share code on Github, write clear documentation, Tweet
interesting links, and share tutorials explaining your work, or anything
software development-related: thank you. It's because of you that I've been able
to advance so quickly in one short year. It's because of you that I'll be able
to continue learning for as long as my curiosity lasts, and thus prepare myself
to contribute to bettering the Internet as a safe place that fosters
connectivity and innovation.

Now let's get to work. There's a revolution happening ;)
