title: Growth and Exploration, Dude

This summer I'm participating in the CMU McNair Scholars Program Summer Research
Institute (SRI) which involves conducting an independent research project with a
faculty member, preparing to take the GRE in August, scoping out prospective
graduate schools, and readying myself apply to graduate school. Oh, and engaging
in personal growth too. I plan to chronicle my experiences as a McNair Scholar
here mostly because Lynn said so...and also because I can appreciate the process
of writing and sharing, especially during a time of great growth and
exploration.

If there's one thing I appreciate about CMU's McNair program it's the holistic
model for developing not just erudite scholars, but healthy, aware, and balanced
individuals. To give you an idea of how the program achieves this, I'll share
some of the cool things my fellow scholars and I have had the opportunity to
explore during the first week of the SRI:

* yoga belly dancing. (mad respect for belly dancers)
* meditation
* high ropes course
* horseback riding
* personal fitness training group
* training for The Color Run
* community gardening

Awesome, right? Ok, I'll admit, some of it was a little bit out of my (old)
comfort zone, but I jumped in and tried each of the above-listed activities with
gusto. Because why not? I'll tell you why not. Because it might be scary. It
might feel uncomfortable, unusual, different. I can promise you that it hurts.
My muscles feel like they went through a meat grinder, thanks to an intense
group fitness session this morning and a run with one of my fellow scholars,
Andy, last night.

Yes, my body hurts. But the aches and pains plaguing my muscles and bones are
evidence of the intense challenges I've stepped up to this week. And when I wake
up in the morning with renewed with strength and vitality, I will be reminded
that the pain of the past may endure for some time, but perseverance results in
new-found strength.

This summer will undoubtedly be arduous. I have a full-fledged research project
to complete, the GRE is months away, and I'm preparing a manuscript for
publication (ugh). I'm fully prepared to dodge, dip, dive, duck, and dodge in
order to avoid the wrenches that life is bound to throw at me. Even if a wrench
hits me square in the face and breaks my nose, I'll remind myself:

I'm breathing. I'm smiling. I'm alive.

Are you?
