Today was marked by the realization that when one asks for help at the Recurse
Center, amazing things happen.

I woke up this morning with the intention of addressing the issue with my zsh
configuration as quickly as possible. The bug had dragged on to the
point that I was thoroughly frustrated, so before I spent any time
tackling it myself, I asked for help in zulip and sure enough a bunch
of folks jumped in with suggestions. Not only did I figure out the bug in ~30
min, but I also got a number of recommendations and resources for
leveling up my zsh configuration.

On the suggestion of an RC alum, I reached out to [David
Branner](https://github.com/brannerchinese) for butcher and deli
recommendations. She told me that he knows the city incredibly well
and would likely be able to help me find some places that suit my
dietary preferences. I expected a friendly response at most, but
instead David offered to meet me at RC and show me around
Chinatown. He spent 3 hours giving me a world-class tour of the three
Chinatowns (I had no idea there were three!), imparting his wisdom about
navigating the city, sharing historical tidbits about the area, and
teaching me about the many varieties of unfamiliar meats available for
purchase, both prepared and raw. I'm a carnivore who loves organ meats,
cartilage, skin, and other animal parts that most Americans
avoid, so having access to Chinatown and feeling comfortable navigating
its restaurants and supermarkets is a blessing.

Some other things I did:

* Started publishing publishing my [reading
notes](https://github.com/taravancil/reading-notes)
* Completed another [hackerrank
challenge](https://gist.github.com/taravancil/a70a1ec2df9025c53a1001477d947173)
* Read one of [Blockstack's
whitepapers](https://blockstack.org/articles/login-paper)
* Worked on my password manager. I haven't been moving as quickly as
I'd like on this, so tomorrow I'm going to see if anyone who knows
Rust is willing to pair for a while.
