*On Writing* is Stephen King's reflection on writing, constructed as
part-autobiography and part-styleguide, and much less tactical writing guide
than one might expect from a book about writing by one of the world's bestselling authors.

King's telling of how he became a writer is scattered with side-stitching stories
about poison ivy and heartwarming affirmations of his [wife Tabby's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabitha_King)
role in his commerical success. You might think an autobiography in a book like this would
be gratuitous and boring, but it's important groundwork that's required for
you to believe King when he later tells you how to become a good writer: read a lot,
write a lot, cut out the excess (it's there), and *tell the truth*.

The second part of the book is a quick and dirty guide about how to write well.
It doesn't contain much in the way of grammar rules, other than him
suggestion that adverbs are rarely necessary and more often a vessel for sloppy
communicating, and his cautioning about adverbs disguised as juiced-up
verbs like "pontificate".

Most importantly, King offers the slightly vague premise that being a good
writer requires telling the truth. What he means is that you can only write
well about what you know, whether that's botany, being a high school girl whose
classmates throw tampons at her, or just being human. He's not suggesting then
that all fiction writers are bad writers (he writes fiction himself),
but that all masterful writers have tapped into some magic that allows them to
craft a believable fabric of untruths about what it's like to exist in
their fictional universe.

*On Writing* is one of the best books I've ever read, and I smiled more throughout
it than any other book I can recall. If you enjoy reading, writing, or laughing, I
can't recommend it enough.
