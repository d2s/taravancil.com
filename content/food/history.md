title: A history of my diet

## Childhood

At least at my mom's house (where I ate most of my meals), we definitely ate meat every day. My mom is more than competent in the kitchen, and she often prepared decadent casseroles, roasts, stews, and more. We also ate a lot of sugary snacks and [juices](http://juicyjuice.com/products/juicy-juice-fruit-juice/apple).

While I don't remember my diet during this period in great detail, I do remember the stomach aches. Nearly every morning I'd lie awake, my stomach writhing with deep, achy hunger pains, and my body feeling weak and shaky.

Most nights I ate a snack (probably a Little Debbie snack cake) and a glass of whole milk immediately before bed. I *never* went without food. There was always something to eat in our fridge, and trust me, I ate. Yet nearly every morning, I experienced hunger so severe it stole away sleep.

At school I ate cafeteria lunches, which were usually pizza or a sandwich, "salad", canned vegetables, and milk.

## Middle and high school

The stomach aches continued through middle school. In high school they got worse.

A typical day during my teenage years looked like this:

* 0600: Stomach ache
* 0700: Wake up, eat breakfast (usually with milk), drive to school.
* 0800: Go to homeroom. Eat another breakfast. This time it's the free, school-provided breakfast of milk, cereal, a pop tart, and a piece of fruit.
* 0830: Classes
* 1015: Stomach twisting and turning. I'm ravenous and in pain. Can't focus.
* 1045: Lunch period. Sometimes I ate school cafeteria lunches. Other times I went for our lunch and piece of pizza and soda at the local pizza joint.
* 1130: Classes
* 1400: Hungry again. Ouch. Eager to go to the vending machine after school.
* 1500: School's out! Grab a Pop Tart, granola bar, or crackers from the vending machine.
* 1530: Volleyball/basketball/softball practice
* 1730: Go home. Eat dinner, which was usually a frozen dinner, Ramen noodles, or pizza. And a bowl or two of Peanut Butter Crunch for good measure.

I was a three sport athlete and very active in other school activities, so I chalked up my hunger to being busy and having a fast metabolism.

## Freshman year of college

I ate a huge amount of calories. I had an unlimited meal plan at the cafeteria in my dorm, so I could eat as much as I wanted as often as I wanted.

While my meals there consisted of more meats and vegetables than what I ate in high school, dinner was almost always punctuated by ice cream, a cookie, or some other sweet treat.

I also drank a lot of frozen slurpees late at night.

Except for walking to class and an occasional half-mile jog, I didn't exercise.

Stomach pains continued.

## The rest of college (2011-2014)

I became a vegetarian. My motivation was two-pronged:

1. Stave off diabetes, high-cholesterol, heart disease, and weight gain
2. Save the animals!

I ate a lot of lentils, eggs, cheese, and milk. I still ate a lot of desserts and slurpees.

I gained 25 lb during this period. When I started college, I was 125 lb soaking wet, and by the time I left college I weighed 150 lb. I'm 5'10", so I was by no measure overweight, but I was thicker than I had ever been.

Stomach pains? You betcha.

## After college (2014-2015)

I upped my commitment to "Save the animals!" and became vegan.

I also stopped eating so many desserts, and cooked almost all of my meals at home.

I did what a good vegan is supposed to do: I prepared my meals with a wide variety of plant-based ingredients, and always took care to include ample protein (lentils, seitan, and tofu). I chose whole grains over processed grains, and minimized the amount of oil I cooked with.

I ate sandwiches on whole grain breads, topped with greens, sprouts, and other fresh vegetables. I guzzled down multiple smoothies a day made with fruit, vegan protein powder, kale, flaxseed, and almond milk.

I thought I was eating well, and I thought my weight reflected that. I lost the weight I gained in college, and usually sat around 120-125 lb. I now realize that's pretty light for someone as tall as me. I also started weightlifting regularly, but my strength *barely* increased and I was frustrated.

I had to eat frequently when I was vegan to avoid feeling like I was going to pass out. I still had stomach aches, but again, I wrote them off as a symptom of my "fast metabolism".

### Things Go Downhill

One evening I was hanging out at a [Texas NORML](https://www.facebook.com/TXNORML) meeting, when without warning, I passed out. I suddenly lost my ability to speak, see, or stand, and quite embarrassingly, dropped to the floor.

Luckily this happened in a crowd of stoners who were armed with snacks and eager to share. I recovered quickly and without incident.

I stayed vegan for several months after that night, but in that period my lifts *still* didn't improve and I *still* felt like crap, despite eating what I thought was a diet as healthy as could be.

I was frustrated, so I decided to explore other options.

## 2015 - present

I learned about the [ketogenic diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketogenic_diet), a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet.

I learned about the history of agriculture, and that the prevalence of grains, flours, and refined sugars in the human diet is a relatively recent phenomenon.

I learned about the metabolic theory of cancer.

I learned about ketosis, and how our livers and brains operate under ketotic conditions.

I learned that rates of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in the United States are alarming, and that the symptoms I displayed (dizziness, rapid weight loss, fainting) sometimes signal the onset of Type 2 diabetes.

I learned that eating a high-carbohydrate diet was not my only option, and might actually be the source of my discomfort and near-constant hunger.

### A major change

A vegan ketogenic diet is incredibly difficult to maintain, and arguably not a healthy choice. Bacon, butter, eggs, and fatty steaks are staples in most ketoers' diets, so I had to make a choice.

Save the animals or save myself?

I opted to save myself. I took my inability to build muscle and blacking out as warning signs, and switched to a ketogenic diet.

It was tough at first. The keto flu is no joke, and it laid me up for several days. After that, I was fine.

I've intermittently eaten a ketogenic diet since May 2015. I say intermittently because although I believe with confidence that a keto diet is the best diet for my health, I regularly falter and binge on pizza and other carb-filled foods. But mostly pizza.

I usually utilize these carb binges as an opportunity to gain weight (which I find supremely challenging while keto), but without fail, the stomach aches come back and I feel terrible.

I didn't realize how terrible I felt until I experienced ketosis. I *never* feel the stomach aches when I'm ketosis. Sure I get hungry, but it feels more like a dull ache rather than a roaring pain.

As of June 2016, I feel great. I've built muscle, my lifts have improved, and I'm satisfied with my weight and body composition. I sit around 140 lb, but I can get to 145 lb. if I try hard.

I weighed 130 lb. in the top-left photo. Do you see my ribs sticking out? And my weak chicken legs? That's not even the skinniest I've ever been :(

Eating a ketogenic diet is easy, cheap, and delicious. I eat bacon, eggs, fatty steaks, butter, heavy cream, and a few other things. I eat once or twice a day instead of six or seven. I don't wake up with hunger pains every morning. I feel excellent and I'm damn pleased about it.

Now if I could just limit how frequently I'm tempted by pizza...

To be continued...
