title: The worst keto flu I've ever had
date: 2016-06-20

Upon returning home from [my trip to Michigan](/food/2016-06-06), I was prepared for a few days of grogginess as my body readjusted to burning fat. I did *not* expect a week and a half of the worst keto flu I've ever experienced, but that's exactly what I got.

My brain was foggy, my muscles felt achy and weak, and I wanted to sleep 14 hours a day. It was bad.

I have no clue why it hit me with such force this time around. I ate less than 20g of carbs/day the entire time, I ate plenty of fat, and I even ramped up my intake of coffee with butter/coconut oil.

Not to my surprise, my lifts were dreadful last week. I could barely squat the bar for 5 reps, and my overhead press was just as bad. I eventually decided to hold off on lifting until I regained some of my strength, and did high-volume pushups and body squats at home throughout the week. I expect my lifts will be much better this week.

It was challenging to even think let alone be productive last week, so I'm thrilled that I feel energetic and clear-minded now.
