title: About me
---

I'm co-founder of Blue Link Labs, the team that builds [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com),
a peer-to-peer Web browser, and [Hashbase](https://hashbase.io),
a cloud peer service for files hosted with the Dat protocol.

Before Blue Link Labs, I worked at Cloudflare, and before that I spent time at
the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), an amazing community for programmers.
