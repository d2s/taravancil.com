title: About me
---

I'm a person who writes code. Call me a software developer or whatever you
like.

I live in Austin, TX, where I enjoy working with and learning about computers, weightlifting <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>, and eating fatty steaks.

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tbvancil) and [Github](https://github.com/taravancil).

    , that is. I suck, but I enjoy it so much.
