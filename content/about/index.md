Hi. I'm Tara. I'm co-founder of Blue Link Labs, the team that builds [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com),
a peer-to-peer Web browser, and [Hashbase](https://hashbase.io),
a cloud peer service for files hosted with the Dat protocol.

Before Blue Link Labs, I worked at Cloudflare helping where I helped build their [Apps platform](https://cloudflare.com/apps/), and before that I spent time at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), an amazing community for programmers.

I'm passionate about re-decentralizing the Web.
