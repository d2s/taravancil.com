title: About Me
---

I'm a person who writes code. Call me a software developer or whatever you
like. I believe that prioritizing performance, security, and privacy when
building technology is non-negotiable. Not doing so feels disrespectful.

I began learning to code in mid-2014, after becoming curious about how to
manipulate the HTML and CSS on a WordPress site I was managing. I later
progressed to learning JavaScript, and have since built things in Python, Go,
and Rust.

Lately I've been spending my time learning and [practicing](https://github.com/taravancil/advent) Rust, in part because I want
to learn more about systems programming, but also because I'm interested in
financial cryptography, and I suspect that when Rust is mature enough, many
blockchain, Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. applications will be built in Rust
<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>.

I'm a borderline boring but thoroughly content person. My hobbies include
weightlifting <sup>[2](#footnote2)</sup>, learning about computers, and
eating fatty steaks.

<a name="footnote1">[1]</a> In fact, one such application *is* built in Rust:
[Parity](https://github.com/ethcore/parity), one of the several Ethereum
clients.

<a name="footnote2">[2]</a> [Weightlifting the sport]
(https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_weightlifting), that is. It's a uniquely simple sport that's incredibly difficult to do well. I suck, but I
enjoy it so much.
