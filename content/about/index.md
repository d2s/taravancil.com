Hi. I'm Tara. I'm co-founder of [Blue Link Labs](https://bluelinklabs.com), the team behind
[Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com), a peer-to-peer Web browser, and
[Hashbase](https://hashbase.io), a cloud peer service for files hosted with the
[Dat protocol](https://github.com/datproject/dat).

Before starting Blue Link Labs, I worked at Cloudflare, where I helped build
their [Apps platform](https://cloudflare.com/apps/), and before that I spent
time at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com), an amazing community for programmers.

I grew up in [rural northern Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine,_Michigan), but I currently reside in Austin, TX.

I'm passionate about re-decentralizing the Web.

## Support my work

The best way to support my work is to sign up for [Hashbase
Pro](https://hashbase.io/pricing). Alternatively, you can support Beaker on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/beaker).

## Stay in touch

I'm @taravancil on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/taravancil), [GitHub](https://github.com/taravancil), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/taravancil) and pretty much everywhere else.

I hang out in #beakerbrowser and #dat on freenode. Drop by and say hello!
