  'Beaker is an experimental peer-to-peer browser built with Electron. Beaker
   implements [Dat](https://datproject.org)</a>, a
   BitTorrent-style protocol for syncing and sharing files on a peer-to-peer
   network.

   With tools for staging and reviewing a project’s changes, viewing a websites
   at any point in its version history, and secretly sharing files without
   using a third-party service, Beaker aims to be a powerful toolset for
   publishing files and websites on the peer-to-peer Web.

   I’m responsible for implementing interfaces that clearly communicate
   novel Web browser actions.'
