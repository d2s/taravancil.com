  A service for rehosting files on the peer-to-peer Web.
description: |
  Hashbase is a service for rehosting files published with Dat,
  a peer-to-peer data syncing protocol.

  Hashbase is the counterpart to Beaker and Dat — because Dat archives are hosted
  directly from the user’s device and by peers on the network, files are not
  download-able if no peers are actively hosting them. Hashbase acts as a
  “super peer” guaranteeing uptime and availability.
