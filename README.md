## Development

This is the source for [tarvancil.com](https://taravancil.com).

The https version of this website is synced from `dat://taravancil.com` using
[dathttpd](https://beakerbrowser/dathttpd). You can open the peer-to-peer
version with [Beaker](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker).

```
npm install
```

then

```
npm start
```

then open `localhost:1313`.

### Building the site

`hugo` builds the site into `public/`. See `hugo -h` for more options.
