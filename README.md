## Development

`npm install` gets the dependencies.

`gulp` builds the `.scss` files, watches for changes in `src/scss/**/*.scss`
and `.html` files in `public/`, and starts the Hugo development server.

### Building the site with Hugo

`hugo` builds the site into `public/`. See `hugo -h` for a full set of options.
